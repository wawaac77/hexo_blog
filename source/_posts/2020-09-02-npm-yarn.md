- node search layer by layer, deeper and deeper, until it finds the corresponding package

- If two packages depend on the same package, but different version. Node_module will keep the two version of the same package.

- The installation order matters. Not every npm install or yarn install, will result in the same node_module structure.

- `npm ci` => will only check `package-lock.json` and build the exact same version. This is recommended to use in the pipleine, so that it can generate the exact same node_module and every build is predictable
    
    `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
