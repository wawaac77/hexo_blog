### 今天关于智力的思考 
关于智力，我们有时候会听到别人评价谁谁谁非常聪明，某些学校的学生智商很高，某个行业的人智商很高，这是一种永远不会过时的迷人评价。如果自己也可以得到这样的评价，并且是真诚的，那也是一种很过瘾的感觉。当自我评价时，我不知道有多少人可以一直确信自己非常的聪明，从不会自我怀疑。不过至少我不是，自我评价有时候像心情一样像海浪一样，高低起伏，当觉得自己智商平庸的时候，常问自己是不是永远不可能像天赋者一样超越一个因为智商而产生的天花板？

理性的回答这个问题，有两个我认为是真相的重点：
1. 不是智商越高越能取得卓越的成就。智商的定义每个人的理解可能不同，但无论广义狭义，智商所描述的东西不太包含道德这个概念。而道德某些程度契合了事物运行之道，所以智商是成就的子集，智商是成就之木桶的一个板子。

2. 聪明是一个词，一个标签，简短且吸引人，而造成了细节被藏在不被人注意的背后，感官上造成了一种似乎天生的东西。人们原因把聪明当做原因，可是要我说，聪明是一种结果。我坚信聪明是努力可以获取的东西。

### 我认为的聪明的真相
我认为聪明的成因在于，因为巧合、环境、成长经历造就的不平庸的思维方式、解决问题的方式、快速学习的方式等。在未察觉的，无痛苦的过程中，形成了当事人都觉得人本该如此的习惯。

以此为基石，聪明人一定是持续学习的。那么如果学习那么累，那么痛苦，那么有负担，又如何持续的每天长时间的学习、思考、突破自己呢？

所以学习一定是不痛苦的、没有负担的，至少大部分时间都不是。

那么学习如何不辛苦呢？一是喜欢，二是习惯。

如何喜欢？精通就会喜欢。

如何习惯？做着做着就习惯了。

### 聪明的加速度
另外一方面，对世界了解的多了，很多事情触类旁通，思维角度更广阔，理解事情更顺畅，也更有兴趣去了解更多的事情，这是每一步都做好一点点，多好奇一点点，带来的复利一般的智力的正循环。

### Thinking about intelligence of today
About intelligence, we can always hear others comment someone else that he/she is super clever, students from some schools have very high IQ, or people belonging to certain industries are extraordinary smart. They are very attractive comments and never out-of-date. If we are one of them who receive this kind of commments sincerely, it must be very good feeling. 

When coming to self evaluation, I don't know how many people could always be sure that they are super intelligent, and never doubt themselves. At least, I'm not one of them. Self evaluation is like mood, like sea wave, sometimes high, but sometimes low. When I recongnise myself as ordinary person, I always ask myself: Is it impossible to achieve something like a talent? Is it impossible to overcome a ceiling formed because of IQ?

To answer these questions rationally, here are two key points which I believe are the truth:
1. It does not mean the higher your IQ is, the more outstanding life you will achieve. Everyone could have different understandings on IQ, no matter a broad or a narrow definition, what IQ describes does not cover the concept of morality. However, morality indicates how the world works to some extend. So IQ can only be a subset of achievement. IQ is one of the staves of a barrel.

2. Intelligence is a word, a tag, which is short and attractive. It makes details hidden behind it. It makes people feel intelligence is something born with. Peopke see intelligence as the reason, while from my perspective, intelligence is a result. I believe intelligence is something that can be achieved as long as you want.

### The truth of intelligence in my opinion
I believe the form of intelligence is due to coincidence, environment, expeirence, how you grow up, and etc, which brings outstanding ways of thinking, problem solving, decision making, fast learning and etc. With an unnoticable and non-painful process, the intelligent people forms some extraordinary habits that they think are oridinary.

With it as a foundation, intelligent people keep learning. But if learning is tiring, painful and a burden, how could they keep learning, thinking, and getting out of comfort zone every day?

So learning is definitely not tiring, painful or a burden, at least most of the time is not.

So how to make learning not tiring? One is passion. The other is habit.

How to have passion? Be good at it!

How to form the habit? Just do it day by day!

### Acceleration of intelligence
Also, when we know more about the world, we will feel many things are connected and similiar, we will have a broader vision on thinking, we will understand things much smoother, and we will be more interested in knowing more things. Just a little bit better on each step, a little bit more curious, the positive feedback it brings will be like compound interest.
